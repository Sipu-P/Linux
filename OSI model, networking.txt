OSI MODEL {Open System Interconnection Model}

 >> Usually we connect two computers through LAN cables,but if one is windows and other is mac we can't connect
	through LAN , that's why OSI model is used to transfer data over a network.
	OSI model defines that how data is transfered from one computer to another computer in a computer network.
	
 >> OSI stands for (Open Systems Interconnection).
    It has been developed by ISO – ‘International Organization for Standardization‘,in the year 1984.
	It is a 7 layer architecture with each layer having specific functionality to perform.
	All these 7 layers work collaboratively to transmit the data from one person to another across the globe. 
	
 >> OSI model consist of 7 layers,and each layer having a paricular network function.
 
 
         7. Application Layer
		 
		 6. Presentation Layer
		 
		 5. session Layer
		 
		 4. Transport Layer
		 
		 3. Network Layer
		 
		 2. Data Link Layer
		 
		 1. Physical Layer
		 
		 
 >> 7. Application Layer
     
    >> It ensures an application can effectively communicate with other applications 
	   on different computer systems and networks.
	
    >> Application Layer provides a facility by which users can forward several emails and 
	   it also provides a storage facility.	
	
	>> It allows users to log on as a remote host
	
	>> It handles issues such as network transparency, resource allocation and so on.
	   
    >> The application layer provides several protocols which allow any software
	   to easily send and receive information and present meaningful data to its users.
	   The protocols are such as TELNET,DNS,DHCP,FTP ..etc.

 >> 6. Presentation Layer	   
 
    >>  This layer is also known as Translation layer,
	    as this layer serves as a data translator for the network.
		The data which this layer receives from the Application Layer is extracted and
		manipulated here as per the required format to transmit over the network.
		
	>> This layer takes care that the data is sent in such a way that,
	   the receiver will understand the information (data) and will be able to use the data efficiently and effectively.	
	   
	>> This layer basically deals with the presentation part of the data.

    >> The presentation layer is also called as Syntax layer since,
	   it is responsible for maintaining the proper syntax of the data,
	   which it either receives or transmits to other layer(s).	
	   
 >> 5. Session Layer 

    >> This layer allows users on different machines to establish active communications sessions between them.
	
    >> This layer basically provides a mechanism of opening,
	   closing and managing a session between the end-user application processes.	
	   
	>> Session Layer uses some protocols which are required for safe,
	   secure and accurate communication which exists between two-ender user applications, such as ADSP,RTCP and PPTP.
	 
 >> 4. Transport layer

    >> The data in the transport layer is referred to as Segments.
	   It is responsible for the End to End Delivery of the complete message. 
	   
	>>  The transport layer also provides the acknowledgement of the successful data transmission and
	    re-transmits the data if an error is found.
		
	>>  Transport layer is operated by the Operating System(OS).
	    It is a part of the OS and communicates with the Application Layer by making system calls. 
     ** Transport Layer is called as Heart of OSI model. 
	   
 >> 3. Network Layer 

    >> The network layer works for the transmission of data from one host to the other located in different networks.
	   It also takes care of packet routing .
	   
    >> The function of network layer are two types, i.e routing,logical addressing.
	   
    >> (ROUTING) - The network layer protocols determine which route is suitable from source to destination.
	               This function of the network layer is known as routing.
				   
    >> (Logical Addressing) - In order to identify each device on internetwork uniquely,
	                          the network layer defines an addressing scheme. The sender & receiver’s
							  IP addresses are placed in the header by the network layer.
							  Such an address distinguishes each device uniquely and universally.	
							  
 >> 2. Data Link Layer	
 
    >> The data link layer is responsible for the node-to-node delivery of the message.
	   The main function of this layer is to make sure data transfer is error-free from one node to another,
	   over the physical layer. When a packet arrives in a network,
	   it is the responsibility of DLL to transmit it to the Host using its MAC address. 
	   
   >>  Data Link Layer is divided into two sublayers: Logical Link Control (LLC),Media Access Control (MAC)

   >>  Data Link layer is handled by the NIC (Network Interface Card) and device drivers of host machines. 
  
   >> The functions of the Data Link layer are :  Framing,Physical Addressing,Error control,Flow control,Acess control.


 >> 1. physical Layer 

    >> The lowest layer of the OSI model is the physical layer.
	   It is responsible for the actual physical connection between the devices.
	   
    >> The physical layer contains information in the form of bits.

    >>  Physical Layer devices are Hub, Repeater, Modem, Cable.
	
    >>  Network Layer, Data Link Layer, and Physical Layer are also known as Lower Layers or Hardware Layers.
